Problem Statement and Solution Expected:

1. This is a binary classification problem. Sentiment needs to be predicted as accurately as possible
2. Other than Polarity, all other columns may be used as predictors as needed.
3. Relevant features need to be created from text column using NLP techniques and combined with other categorical and numeric raw or calculated features before 
   proceeding to modelling
4. Predictive modelling needs to be done with hyper-parameter tuning if needed for the chosen algorithm and parameter selection steps clearly mentioned. Also relevant 
   validation metrics should be calculated and clearly printed on validation/test sets. Modeling recommendations may also be supressed in some cases by hard coded 
   rules if necessary and found useful
7. Descriptive analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis) should precede any modelling efforts and all insights from the data should be communicated in comments 
   in the Notebook also supported by any tables/charts/graphs.
